# Expo Router Navigation Hierarchy

Navigation structure: `Stack > Drawer > Tabs > Screens`

- **Stack** (`_layout.tsx`) — Root layout, wraps all navigation. Modals sit directly on the stack (bypass drawer/tabs).
- **Drawer** (`(drawer)/_layout.tsx`) — Main app shell with side menu. Contains tabs and standalone screens.
- **Tabs** (`(drawer)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`) — Bottom tab navigation for primary sections.

## Rules
- Modals go at the Stack level, outside the Drawer
- Standalone screens (not in tabs) go at the Drawer level
- Screens within a tab section go inside `(tabs)/`
- This hierarchy prevents visual glitches and keeps navigation predictable
